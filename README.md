# Prototype 2 - Snowdrift

For my second prototype, I wanted to make a more relaxed game than Chocolate Quake - this one's called Snowdrift, and is a very short exploration-based game during winter.



The main question I wanted to ask was the following:

### What are the natural instincts of a player in an isometric perspective? Where are people drawn to, what do they want to explore, and what type of level design can influence those choices?

1. First, I set up an isometric scene of a winter terrain, using proprietary Unity tools.
2. I initially tried out a 2D sprite-based character, but this made it hard to gauge 3D space while exploring, so I opted for a capsule character instead.
3. I found a series of public domain/creative commons assets for trees and rocks, which I started placing around the scene. Additionally, I added the Unity Standard Assets Kit and built a basic house. Everything else was either built in Unity or by using placeholder geometry.
4. I recorded some banjo music over creative commons winter ambience, in order to give the game a sense of space and to immerse the player in the environment a bit more.
5. Using other Unity assets I had, I quickly implemented a dialogue system and a basic inventory system, in order to do let the player do minor tasks - these dialogue trees were conditional and dependent on where the player would be in a particular "questline", i.e. Started, Doing, Finished, etc.
6. I rearranged a lot of the geometry to help guide the player in where there'd be content - that said, I'm hoping to see player instincts during playtests, to see how well this worked and where and to what the player would explore on their own - to some extent, to build a "heat map" of the environment in game.
7. I added flavor NPCs and interactable world objects, to help reward the player for exploring. Hopefully, these stand out more and the player will search them out.



## PLAYTEST QUESTIONS

- Did you feel like you were exploring an actual space/environment?
- Did you want to explore the map and see what you could find?
- Was the dialogue system easy to grasp? How easily understandable was the inventory?
- Did you feel like you were led on a path, or did you feel free to explore whatever?
- Where did you want to go?
- Did the isometric perspective hinder your enjoyment or your ability to explore the game?
- What things drew your attention?
